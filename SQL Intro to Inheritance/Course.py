    The ForeignKey argument to the mapped_column method is not needed because I am 
    specifying this foreign key constraint in the __table_args__ call farther down
    in the code.  I can do this either "in-line" using ForeignKey in the mapped_column
    call, OR (exclusive OR here) do it in __table_args__.
    
    If we have more than one column in the primary key of the parent, then we 
    MUST use __table_args__, we canNOT express the foreign key constraint using
    ForeignKey.  I show you how to do it in __table_args__ because you'll need
    that for the relationship from courses into sections.
